### HelloðŸ‘‹
### I'm an aspiring software engineer

- Currently working on Tivelet for 3, a Roblox open world rpg with souls like combat
  
- I have 4 years of experience with Lua, and Python
- I have 3 years of experience with C++, and Java

- ðŸ¤” I am currently learning Rust, Type-Script

- My favourite abstract data structure is the FILO stack
- My proudest achievement is being top 100 or top 2% in the CCC junior contest 2023. My first ever competitive contest!

- For 2024, I want to...
1. Finalize the alpha release of Tivelet
2. Become appreciative of everyone's qualities rather than critical of others's imperfections
3. Get into the CCO and hopefully participate in Canada's IOI team and be a gold medalist
